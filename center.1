.Nd center align text
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads files sequentially, writing each line center aligned to the standard output.
The
.Ar file
operands are processed in command-line order.
If
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Sq -
or absent,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
When run without arguments, the width on which the output should be centered is automatically
determined.
When the output device is a TTY, this is done via the
.Fn isatty
function.
When the output device isn't a terminal then the user is required to pass a width via the
.Fl w
flag.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Do not take ANSI color escape sequences into account when centering input.
This will cause input containing ANSI color escape sequences to fail to be visually centered.
.It Fl w Ar width
Center align the input as if the output device has a width of
.Ar width .
This option is required when the output device is not a terminal.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Center align the contents of
.Ar file1
and
.Ar file2
to the standard output:
.Pp
.Dl $ center file1 file2
.Pp
Center align a calendar and then follow it with the contents of the file
.Ar file1 ,
writing the output to the file
.Ar file2 .
Align the calendar as if the output device has a width of 80 columns.
.Pp
.Dl $ cal | center -w 80 | cat - file1 > file2
.Pp
Center align the contents of
.Ar file1
and write the output to
.Ar file2
as if the output device had the same width as the current TTY.
This requires non\-standard extensions, and you should refer to the
.Xr tput 1
manual page.
.Pp
.Dl $ center -w `tput cols` file1 > file2
